# WhiteHouseRealityCheck.com
Whitehouse.gov with inline fact-checking. Fight alternative facts with the real thing.

Under President Trump, the official White House website is now being used to spread disinformation. The goal of this site is to show their "alternative" facts right alongside the real thing, using verifiable sources, data, and images. Submissions are welcome: I aim to build a community so that as new disinformation is added to whitehouse.gov, we update whitehouserealitycheck.com to fight back.
